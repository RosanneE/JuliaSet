JuliaSet
========

This project is my implimentation of the Julia set.  The .py file uses the Python library pygame for graphics.  If pygame is installed, you can run it with the command:

python Julia.py

In case you do not have pygame, I translated the program to Java.  You can compile and run it with the command below:

javac JuliaSet.java
java JuliaSet
